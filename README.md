# Commands

### !song 
Sends the currently playing track and artist(s) to the chat.

### !sr <song name | link> [link...]
Adds a track to the queue by name or link.

When a track is added, a Spotify notification will appear showing which user added the track and its title.

When searching by name, you can optionally include the artist to improve search results.

If a link is recognized but the track is not available on Spotify, the bot will attempt to find it by searching for the track name.

Multiple links can be sent in a single message (see examples below).

    <li><kbd>!sr Billie Jean Michael Jackson</kbd>

### !rm [name or index from the end]
Removes one of your previously requested tracks from the queue.

Without arguments, removes your most recently requested track.

You can provide an index (counting from the end of **your requests**) or remove a track by searching for part of its title or artist.

If you are the broadcaster or a moderator, you can remove **any track** by searching for part of its title or artist.
